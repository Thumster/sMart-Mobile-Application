### Reinventing the Supermarket Experience
---
## Problem
In our world today, we understand that time is a precious and limited resource and many young adults find it difficult to take out some time from their busy schedules to go out of their way to the supermarket to do shopping for daily essentials.

## Our Solution

Introducing sMart, a smart supermarket shopping solution that aims at helping people like Leo to ensure that he gets all the items he needs in the shortest possible time from entry to checkout. This is achieved by mapping out the shortest path through all his pre-selected items on his mobile application using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled indoor navigation system. With the aid of RFID sensors mounted on supermarket carrier equipment (SCE), such as baskets & trolleys, and RFID tags on the products, whenever Leo walks by an item on his list or an item on promotion, his sMart mobile application will ping him to notify him. Any item that he drops in his SCE is also immediately scanned. This solution also extends to learning and predicting Leo’s shopping habits and helping him acquire more items every trip he makes so that he can make fewer trips down to the supermarket overall, thereby helping him to save even more time.

With the help of sensors and understanding of the context, sMart is capable of providing a breakthrough in Leo’s shopping efficiency. sMart’s pervasive aspect lies in the recommendations provided to Leo behind the scenes. The algorithms are able to detect the needs and wants of Leo, through the identification of Leo’s shopping habits, and proceed to make subconscious decisions for him. The recommendations include but are not limited to, the navigation route when Leo begins his shopping, entirely based on his shopping list and also recommending similar items to notify Leo of better alternatives and promotions. Ultimately, sMart aims to awaken Leo’s shopping ability and to achieve his objectives completely unbeknownst to him.
